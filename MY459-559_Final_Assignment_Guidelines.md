# MY459/MY559 Quantitative Text Analysis Project Guidelines

The final summative assessment for MY459 is a written analysis of approximately 3,000 words, due at the beginning of ST 2020, which forms 40% of the course grade.

The final summative assessment for MY559 is a written analysis of approximately 4,000-5,000 words, with a more detailed research component expected. This does not differ in kind from the MY459 assessment, only in degree.

## Content
The project replaces a final exam and is designed to give you a chance to analyze a set of texts that you have chosen, reflecting (hopefully) your own research interests. This can be, and probably makes the most sense to be, textual data from something you are already studying. Which texts you choose, what question you investigate, and how you analyze the texts is your choice, but you must justify the choice.
Your content should include the following:

1. **A cover sheet** including the title and your LSE candidate ID.
2. **An abstract page**, with an abstract of no more than 200 words.
3. **Introduction.** An expanded version of your abstract, which introduces the question, states the rationale for trying to answer it, briefly describes your corpus, identifies the methods you apply to the texts, and summarizes the findings.
4. **Motivation.** Why have you chosen to analyze this topic? Is there a compelling social reason? Does it contribute to scholarship? This can include a “literature review” (but don’t overdo it).
5. **Description of your corpus.** You are free to choose any corpus you wish, of any size, although you must include a justification for the choice of texts and acknowledge the source. You will need to document any format conversions or pre-processing steps you have applied to the texts prior to analysis. You should also present some basic summary statistics about the texts, prior to analysis.
6. **Description of your methods.** What techniques will you apply to analyze the texts? Is there a precedent (in previous scholarly literature) for applying such methods to texts similar to yours? Defend why the application of the methods is appropriate.
7. **Results.** Apply the methods, present the findings. Be sure to be explicit about any steps taken.
8. **Conclusions.** What conclusions on the question can we draw from the results?

## Formatting

There is no rigid set of guidelines, but you should use a Chicago manual of style compatible referencing system (parenthetical references rather than footnotes). Tables should be formatted rather than consisting of pasted output from a statistical package. Think of trying to look (roughly) as if you were formatting a journal article.

## Deadline

Monday 2 May 2023, 5pm, to be submitted through Moodle.
